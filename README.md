# proxied-request-machine

the name localhost for files just happens to be spontaneous, to avoid something obvious like multiple-hits

the steps:

1. debug was true, got some urls
2. formatted some of them as strings
3. learnt about the web.app and got jwt from there
[https://bosm-22.web.app/#/](https://bosm-22.web.app/#/)
4. the localhost.py file was originally made to find out about the urls and methods combinations that work, localhost.txt has the corresponding output.
the variables like int:b_id need to be tried out, also the query param convention of django, which i did not need to figure out this time as well.
5. web.app can also give urls
6. using own jwt is risky, thankfully the fresher account exists
7. i see one url available on fresher jwt with a big response.

thats all, i think.


OASIS'22, THE 5OTH ONE

Tried this module for proxies, but it would appear that the proxies are short lived and thus give an error connection refused to proxy, and thus the script is ineffective.
